*(Suggested in Atom: install markdown-preview package to see markdown)*
## Missing things to do:
***
### Graphic part
* **Add app icon and colours**: add logo png image to folder images/ , update
  the manifest.json file accordingly (suggested to add same icon in different
  sizes, say 48x48, 144x144, 256x256, google for more info)
***
### JS Core part
* **Add caching of application shell on install**
* **Add specific caching policies for data fetch requests**
